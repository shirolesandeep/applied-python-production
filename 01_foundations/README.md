# Day 1 – Script to Production Service

## Problem
Script-style Python code often mixes logic and execution,
making it fragile and hard to maintain.

## Solution
Refactored the script into a service class that:
- isolates business logic
- validates inputs
- avoids global execution

## Key Takeaways
- Working code ≠ production-ready code
- Thin classes improve clarity
- Controlled execution is essential
