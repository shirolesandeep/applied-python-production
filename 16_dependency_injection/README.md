# Day 16 — Dependency Injection (Pythonic)

## Goal
Make services testable and flexible by injecting dependencies.

## What Changed
- Logger is injected into services
- Entry point wires dependencies
- Services focus only on business logic

## Why This Matters
- Easier testing
- Cleaner architecture
- Agent-ready design

## Rule
Dependencies are passed in, not created inside.
