# Day 3 – Readability & Naming

## Problem
Python allows very compact code, but compact code is often hard to read.

## Solution
We prefer explicit, readable code with:
- meaningful names
- clear control flow
- minimal nesting

## Key Takeaways
- Readability beats cleverness
- Names should explain intent
- Explicit code is easier to maintain
