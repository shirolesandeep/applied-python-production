# Day 4 – Functions & Guard Clauses

## Problem
Functions often assume inputs are valid, leading to bugs and crashes.

## Solution
Use guard clauses to:
- validate inputs early
- fail fast
- keep logic simple

## Key Takeaways
- Validate at the top
- Fail early with clear errors
- Simple functions are safer functions
